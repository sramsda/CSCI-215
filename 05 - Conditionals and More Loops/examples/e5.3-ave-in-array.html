        Does the Array include the average of all values?

        Write the following program using JavaScript:

            1. Prompt user to enter a series of numeric values separated by comma (see below).
            2. Determine if the average of the numbers is included as one of the numbers.
            3. Note: only use whole numbers.

        Example #1:
        Input: 28,5,27,69,4,8,59
        Output: The average value 28 is included in the list of values 28,5,27,69,4,8,59.

        Example #2:
        Input: 39,34,56,21,18,3,99
        Output: The average value 38 is not included in the list of values 39,34,56,21,18,3,99.

    // input
    let input = prompt("Enter values: ")
    let values = input.split(",");

    // calculations
    let sum = 0; 

    for(let i = 0; i < values.length; i++){
        sum += Number(values[i]); 
    }

    let avg = Math.floor(sum / values.length); 
    // console.log(avg)

    // output
    if(values.includes(String(avg))){
        document.write(`The average value ${avg} is included in the list of values ${input}`); 
    }else{
        document.write(`The average value ${avg} is not included in the list of values ${input}`); 
    }
